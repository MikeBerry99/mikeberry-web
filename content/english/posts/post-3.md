### Notes

Cultural Damage - The importance of safety culture

ChatGPT
Safety culture in DevOps is crucial as it helps to ensure that systems and processes are designed and implemented in a manner that prioritizes the well-being and protection of people, organizations, and the environment. This includes promoting a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating potential risks, promoting collaboration and communication among team members, and continuously monitoring and improving processes. By prioritizing safety culture, organizations can prevent incidents, ensure compliance with regulations, and ultimately, protect the reputation and success of their operations.

# Introduction
One of the things I love about DevOps is the broad base of knowledge that the principles and practises come from. While much of the orginal thinking around Agile was tied to software development, DevOps has always taken the wider view of improving the overall system. It uses ideas taken from Lean manufacturing in Japan and Safety Culture in the airline industry. DevOps builds on the work of management thinking pioneers Peter Drucker and W. Edwards Deming and applies them in the context of modern software management.

So while many people working tech now are familiar with the implementation side of DevOps such as continious integration/continious deployment (CI/CD). Somwtimes the high level priciples are not as well know. And that's a shame because the higher level principles give you much greater power to understand the **why**. In most endevours in software (and in life) understanding the why will get you much further than just knowing the what.

Therefore I present to you my guide to Safety Culture. What is safety culture, how does it apply to software engineering and what lessons can we learn from it?

We begin our journey of understanding in 1943 in the dark night skys of the 

What does a sailor on an aircraft carrier, an air traffic controller and a nuclear power operator all have in common? They all work in environments with complex and hazardous systems which they operate error free. Researchers have studied all three of these organisations to better undestand how they continue to operate so sucessfully in these high risk high impact enviornments. Their research showed that even across these diverse enviornments, these organisations know as High Reliability Organizations (HROs) have many similar characteristics. Although the [inital research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/108602668900300202) focused on high risk industries it has since expanded into other settings including health care and wildfire management.
