### Notes

Cultural Damage - The importance of safety culture

ChatGPT
Safety culture in DevOps is crucial as it helps to ensure that systems and processes are designed and implemented in a manner that prioritizes the well-being and protection of people, organizations, and the environment. This includes promoting a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating potential risks, promoting collaboration and communication among team members, and continuously monitoring and improving processes. By prioritizing safety culture, organizations can prevent incidents, ensure compliance with regulations, and ultimately, protect the reputation and success of their operations.

# Introduction
One of the things I love about DevOps is the broad base of knowledge that the principles and practises come from. From Lean manufacturing in Japan to safety culture in the airline industry. DevOps takes the ideas of management thinking pioneers Peter Drucker and W. Edwards Deming and applies them in the context of modern software management.


What does a sailor on an aircraft carrier, an air traffic controller and a nuclear power operator all have in common? They all work in environments with complex and hazardous systems which they operate error free. Researchers have studied all three of these organisations to better undestand how they continue to operate so sucessfully in these high risk high impact enviornments. Their research showed that even across these diverse enviornments, these organisations know as High Reliability Organizations (HROs) have many similar characteristics. Although the [inital research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/108602668900300202) focused on high risk industries it has since expanded into other settings including health care and wildfire management.
