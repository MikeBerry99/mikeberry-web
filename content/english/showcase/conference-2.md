## Cloud Next 2019 - Google Cloud DevOps: Speed With Reliability and Security

After an earlier talk in Sydney, Australia the Google team asked if I could present at Google Cloud Next in San Francisco. I agreed and prepared a talk about how we use some of the Google tools in our cloud build and deployment pipelines.

Fortunately for me I was able to join in a "Google Cloud DevOps" session that included both tech icons Jez Humble (Continuous Delivery) and Ben Treynor Sloss (Site Reliability Engineering).

My segment starts 21 minutes into the session.
