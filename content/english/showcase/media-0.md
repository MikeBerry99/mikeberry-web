## ANZ Plus - creating a digital first cloud based banking platform

In 2022 ANZ Bank launch a new digital bank with financial wellbeing at its core called ANZ Plus. What had started with 10 or so people when I joined became 1,200 by the time I left to move to the UK. 

The [ANZ Plus proposition](https://www.anz.com.au/plus/tour/) itself is amazing and will improve as it gains more features over time.

The ANZx team building and supporting ANZ Plus are even more amazing. I've never worked anywhere that has so many talented engineers using the latest tools and technology.
