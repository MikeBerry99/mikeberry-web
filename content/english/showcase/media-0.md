## ANZ Plus - a new digital first cloud based banking platform

After many years working with awesome people we've created a new digital banking platform inside ANZ called ANZ Plus. The [ANZ plus proposition](https://www.anz.com.au/plus/tour/) itself is amazing and will improve as it gains more features over time.

The ANZx team building and supporting ANZ Plus are even more amazing. I've never worked anywhere that has so many talented engineers using the latest tools and technology.

If you are interested in creating solutions to help customers improve their financial wellbeing you should join us. We can always use more engineers!
