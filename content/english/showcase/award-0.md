## ANZ Bank Honored as Red Hat Innovation Awards APAC 2018 Winners

#### Categories: Modern Application Development and Digital Transformation

**Winner: ANZ Bank**

ANZ Bank (ANZ) is one of the five largest listed companies in Australia by market capitalization and a leading bank in New Zealand, serving both consumers and businesses in the region. In 2017, ANZ needed to increase the speed of its software release cycle after the work in their API platform had grown significantly during the previous year. To enable a continuous integration and continuous delivery process, ANZ migrated to a solution based on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat Gluster Storage, Red Hat Ansible Tower, and Red Hat Satellite.

The project began in phases in 2017, with migration of more than 25 services into containers within nine months. Using Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, ANZ reports it reduced deployment time from hours to minutes, allowed development teams to deploy their own code into production, automated configuration, and enabled zero downtime deployments. The team also engaged Red Hat Consulting to help upskill the team and migrate the solution.

Since its initial rollout, ANZ added a Blue-Green deployment capability - a methodology that creates two identical production environments which enable upgrades to be made in the parallel environment and facilitate rollbacks to the old environment should a problem surface - in a matter of weeks. This created a continuous integration (CI) service that superseded its old CI processes.

The Modern Application Development category recognizes the organizationâ€™s overall performance in creating, maintaining, and deploying successful business applications through the use of agile methodologies.
