## DevOps Talks Conference 2018 - The road to Kubernetes

This is the story of how a small 5 person "Pitcrew" team grew into a 30+ person Platform Engineering Team. It discusses the importance of starting with culture first, how to create urgency to accept change and how we implemented k8s to improve our end-to-end flow. It is a collection of amusing stories, important lessons we learned (including few failures) and the current status of our DevOps transformation.
