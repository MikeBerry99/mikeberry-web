Having worked in in financial services for many years, I am a fintech geek and love the world of tech start-ups. I have strong opinions about most things Agile, Lean and DevOps. I have spoken about Kubernetes at conferences in the past, although I am now more of serverless advocate. I enjoy all topics to do with leadership and am always learning more about how to run high performing teams.
